Fix SQLAlchemy reserved attribute and enhance CI/CD with comprehensive testing

Fixed critical GitHub Actions failure caused by SQLAlchemy reserved attribute 'metadata'
in PaymentAuditLog model. Renamed to 'payment_metadata' in both model and migration.

Key Changes:
- Fixed: Renamed metadata → payment_metadata in src/models/audit.py
- Fixed: Updated migrations/versions/002_audit_schema.py to match
- Fixed: CI grep pattern now uses word boundaries (\bmetadata\s*=\s*Column)
- Added: 40+ unit tests (test_models.py, test_config.py)
- Enhanced: CI pipeline with app startup, health checks, migration rollback tests
- Added: Comprehensive testing documentation (docs/TESTING.md)
- Added: pytest dependencies to requirements.txt

Impact:
✅ CI pipeline fully functional
✅ Automated unit tests prevent regressions
✅ Application startup verification
✅ Migration validation and rollback testing
✅ Health endpoint monitoring

Files Changed: 8 files (2 core, 1 CI, 1 deps, 2 tests, 2 docs)

Type: bugfix, enhancement
Status: verified and ready for deployment
