Fix SQLAlchemy reserved attribute and enhance CI/CD with comprehensive testing

Fixed critical GitHub Actions failure caused by SQLAlchemy reserved attribute 'metadata'
in PaymentAuditLog model. Fixed environment variable configuration for Settings validation.
Enhanced CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive testing.

Key Changes:
- Fixed: Renamed metadata → payment_metadata in src/models/audit.py
- Fixed: Updated migrations/versions/002_audit_schema.py to match
- Fixed: CI grep pattern uses word boundaries (\bmetadata\s*=\s*Column)
- Fixed: Environment variables (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, ADMIN_USER_IDS, etc.)
- Added: 40+ unit tests (test_models.py, test_config.py)
- Enhanced: CI pipeline with app startup, health checks, migration rollback tests
- Added: Comprehensive testing documentation (docs/TESTING.md)
- Added: pytest dependencies to requirements.txt

Environment Variable Fixes:
✅ BOT_TOKEN → TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN (correct Settings field name)
✅ Added ADMIN_USER_IDS required field
✅ Added PAKASIR_PROJECT_SLUG required field
✅ Added SECRET_KEY required field
✅ Added ENCRYPTION_KEY required field
✅ Updated all CI jobs with correct variable names

Impact:
✅ CI pipeline fully functional (was completely broken)
✅ Automated unit tests prevent regressions
✅ Application startup verification
✅ Migration validation and rollback testing
✅ Health endpoint monitoring
✅ Settings validation works in all environments
